Introductory workshop about http://micronaut.io[Micronaut].

== Software Requirements

=== Micronaut CLI

==== Option 1 (recommended): using SDKMAN!

1. Install http://sdkman.io[SDKMAN!] if you haven't done so already.
2. Install Micronaut CLI:

    $ sdk install micronaut

3. Ensure the CLI is installed properly:

    $ mn --version
    | Micronaut Version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    | Groovy Version: 2.5.0-rc-3
    | JVM Version: 1.8.0_131

==== Option 2: from a ZIP file

1. Grab the latest `-dist.zip` file from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/io/micronaut/cli/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/[]:

    $ wget https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/io/micronaut/cli/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/cli-1.0.0-20180526.063403-21-dist.zip -O micronaut-cli.zip

2. Unzip it under a desired location (eg: `/usr/local/micronaut`):

    $ sudo unzip micronaut-cli.zip -d /usr/local/micronaut
    Password:
    Archive:  micronaut-cli.zip
      inflating: /usr/local/micronaut/cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
      inflating: /usr/local/micronaut/LICENSE
      creating: /usr/local/micronaut/bin/
      inflating: /usr/local/micronaut/bin/mn.bat
      inflating: /usr/local/micronaut/bin/mn
      creating: /usr/local/micronaut/media/
      inflating: /usr/local/micronaut/media/mn.icns

3. Link the `mn` command-line into a directory belonging to your `$PATH` (eg: `/usr/local/bin`):

    $ ln -s /usr/local/micronaut/bin/mn /usr/local/bin/

4. Ensure the CLI is installed properly:

    $ mn --version
    | Micronaut Version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    | Groovy Version: 2.5.0-rc-3
    | JVM Version: 1.8.0_131

=== Other requirements

* JDK 8.
* Git.
* Docker.

=== Clone this repository

Once done, you can clone this repo:

----
git clone https://github.com/alvarosanchez/ratpack-101.git
----

NOTE: You will find each exercise's template files on each `exNN` folder. Solution is always inside a `solution` folder. To highlight the actions you actually need to perform, an icon is used: icon:hand-o-right[]

== Getting started with the Micronaut CLI (10 minutes)

The Micronaut CLI is the recommended way to create new Micronaut projects. The 
CLI includes commands for generating specific categories of projects, allowing 
you to choose between build tools, test frameworks, and even pick the language 
you wish to use in your application. The CLI also provides commands for generating 
artifacts such as controllers, client interfaces, and serverless functions.

The `create-app` command is the starting point for creating Micronaut applications.
The CLI is based on the concept of **profiles**. A profile consist of a project
template (or skeleton), optional features, and profile-specific commands. Commands 
from a profile typically are specific to the profile application type; for example, 
the `service` profile (designed for creation of microservice applications) provides 
the `create-controller` and `create-client` commands.

icon:hand-o-right[] You can list the available profiles with the `list-profiles` command:

----
$ mn list-profiles                                                                                     | Available Profiles
--------------------
* federation - The federation profile
* service - The service profile
* base - The base profile
----

TIP: The Micronaut team is actively working on new profiles, and eventually they 
will be available.

Applications generated from a profile can be personalised with **features**. A 
feature further customises the newly created project by adding additional 
dependencies to the build, more files to the project skeleton, etc. 

icon:hand-o-right[] To see all the features of a profile, you can
use the `profile-info` command:

----
$ mn profile-info service                                                                                Profile: service
