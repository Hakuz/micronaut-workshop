== Getting started with the Micronaut CLI (10 minutes)

The Micronaut CLI is the recommended way to create new Micronaut projects. The 
CLI includes commands for generating specific categories of projects, allowing 
you to choose between build tools, test frameworks, and even pick the language 
you wish to use in your application. The CLI also provides commands for generating 
artifacts such as controllers, client interfaces, and serverless functions.

The `create-app` command is the starting point for creating Micronaut applications.
The CLI is based on the concept of **profiles**. A profile consist of a project
template (or skeleton), optional features, and profile-specific commands. Commands 
from a profile typically are specific to the profile application type; for example, 
the `service` profile (designed for creation of microservice applications) provides 
the `create-controller` and `create-client` commands. 

Profiles can be further customised with **features**.
